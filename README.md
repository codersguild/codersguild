# I ❤️ developing software

I am a mechie-turned full stack developer, pursuing a Ph.D. from IIT Kanpur on Formal & Semi-Formal Verification along with Program Analysis. I am an 
expert on Blockchain technologies namely Fabric, EVM-Solidity & Bitcoin (bitcoin-core) and have a fair understanding on how these work.

Apart from research, I spend time building MERN/PERN Stack web apps for startups or demonstration purpose. I have good working experience with Node.js, Mocha, Jest, Webpack, 
Angular, React, Redux, Overmind, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Socket-io, WebRTC, AWS, GCP, Vercel, Dockers & Kubernetes. I am available for consultation on your tech stack. Feel

# I ❤️ software architecture

For the past two years, I have been consulting various startups on the tect stack they use & the system design for there core apps. Checkout my `System Design` repository for insights and articles I read over the past years. I have implemented some of them for my own ideas and for `PingTrader` as well. Check out `educative.io` for an awesome course on `System Design` (recommended by [highscalability.com](www.highscalability.com))
