# I ❤️ developing software

I am a mechie-turned full stack developer, pursuing a Ph.D. from IIT Kanpur on Formal & Semi-Formal Verification along with Program Analysis. I am an 
expert on Blockchain technologies namely Fabric, EVM-Solidity & Bitcoin (bitcoin-core) and have a fair understanding on how these work.

Apart from research, I spend time building MERN/PERN Stack web apps for startups or demonstration purpose. I have good working experience with Node.js, Mocha, Jest, Webpack, 
Angular, React, Redux, Overmind, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Socket-io, WebRTC, AWS, GCP, Vercel, Dockers & Kubernetes. I am available for consultation on your tech stack. Feel 
free to reach me at lahiri.devs@gmail.com.

#### PS : Not looking for CTO/SDE roles right now. However, I am available for all kinds of tech consultation on need basis.

### Some Good things all developers should do 

- Ask questions and get reviewed when in doubt. 🤔🤔
- Experiment with things, that will help you learn.
- Learn from the experts (if you have the oppurtunity).
- Stick to one project at a time. But do have other projects in your todo. 😉
- Don't work on multiple hot-fixes at the same time. 😠
- Never miss an oppurtunity to learn the basics. (Nothing can replace core CS Fundamentals) 😊
- Keep collaborating.
