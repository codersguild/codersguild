## I ‚ù§Ô∏è developing software

I am a full-stack developer pursuing a Ph.D. from IIT Kanpur on `Program Analysis` & `Verification` using `ML` and `formal methods`. I have been a developer using Blockchain technologies namely `Fabric`, `EVM-Solidity` & `Bitcoin (bitcoin-core)`. My technical expertise lies in delivering full-stack applications from development to deployment.  I have a good working experience with the following. I use them very frequntly and have a good understanding of these languages/tools/frameworks

Want to know a bit more about my background?

## I am ü§© about Software Architecture & System Design

For the past two years, I have been consulting various `startups` on the `tech-stack` they use. Checkout my `System Design` repository for insights and articles I read over the past years. I have implemented some of them for my own ideas and for `PingTrader` & `Pluto-Office` as well. Check out `educative.io` for an awesome course on `System Design` (recommended by [highscalability.com](https://www.highscalability.com)). Below is my `presentation` discussion at [`Uber`](https://eng.uber.com/locations/bangalore/)
